how to train for platelet detection
desktop/tensorflow/models/research/object_detection

label images using hastyai
stick
platelet

get json file from hastyai
convert this to CSV with annotations and images in the CSV(use an online json to csv tool)
test.csv
train.csv


create tf_record
put in object_detection/data
test.record
train.record


make object detection/training dir
pipeline.config  - config file
platelet_object.pbtxt - class file

 
config file
 
feature extractor is faster_rcnn_resnet101  - object_detection/training
 
 
run object_detection/model_main.py with flags, command
python model_main.py 
model_dir= 
pipeline_config_path= training/
num_training_steps= 
eval_training_data=
checkpoint_dir=

 
 observe with tensorboard
 
 export inference graph with object_detection/export_inference_graph.py
 
 inference script is object_detection_image.py

Before you can install either PowerAI Vision stand-alone or PowerAI Vision with IBM Cloud Private, you must configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), enable the Fedora Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository, and install NVIDIA CUDA drivers.
Note Neither IBM® PowerAI nor PowerAI Enterprise are required for running PowerAI Vision.
RHEL and repository requirements
To enable repositories for PowerAI Vision, complete the following steps to configure RHEL 7.5, or later:

    Enable the optional and extra repository channels by running the following commands:
        Run the following commands for a POWER8® server:

        sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-for-power-le-optional-rpms

        sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-for-power-le-extras-rpms
        Copy

        Run the following commands for a POWER9™ server:

        sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-for-power-9-optional-rpms

        sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-for-power-9-extras-rpms
        Copy

    Enable the EPEL repository by running the following commands:

    wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

    sudo rpm -ihv epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    Copy

    Load the RHEL kernel by running the following commands:

    sudo yum update kernel kernel-tools kernel-tools-libs kernel-bootwrapper

    sudo reboot
    Copy

    Install and start Docker by completing the following steps:
        Install Dock by running the sudo yum install docker command.
        Start Docker by running the sudo systemctl start docker command, and start Docker after a system restarts by running the sudo systemctl enable docker command.
        The Docker interface must be in a trusted zone. If you are running the firewalld daemon, you must run the following commands to configure the Docker interface to be in a trusted zone:

        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=docker0

        sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
        Copy

    For more information, see the Docker on IBM Power Systems website.

NVIDIA component requirements
Complete the following steps to configure NVIDIA components for PowerAI Vision:

    On POWER9 systems, you must disable the udev Memory Auto-Onlining Rule to use the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) drivers by completing the following steps:
        Copy the /lib/udev/rules.d/40-redhat.rules file to the directory for user overridden rules by running the sudo cp /lib/udev/rules.d/40-redhat.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ command.
        Edit the /lib/udev/rules.d/40-redhat.rules file by running the sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/40-redhat.rules command, and comment out the following line in the file:SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="add", PROGRAM="/bin/uname -p", RESULT!="s390*", ATTR{state}=="offline", ATTR{state}="online"
        Remove the following line in the file as it does not apply anymore: # do not edit this file, it will be overwritten on update
        Restart the system by running the sudo reboot command.
    Install the CUDA Toolkit 9.2 drivers, or later, by completing the following steps:
        Go to the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit website.
        Click Linux > ppc64le > RHEL > 7 > rpm (local) or rpm (network)
        Install the RPM by running the sudo yum install cuda-repo-rhel7*.ppc64le.rpm command.
        Install the CUDA Toolkit by running the sudo yum install cuda command.
        Verify that the CUDA drivers are installed by running the /usr/bin/nvidia-smi/ application.
